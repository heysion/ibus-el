Description: IBus client for GNU Emacs
 IBus is an Intelligent Input Bus. It is a new input framework
 for Linux OS. It provides full featured and user friendly input
 method user interface. It also may help developers to develop
 input method easily.
 .
 ibus.el is a IBus client for GNU Emacs. This program allows
 users on-the-spot style input with IBus. The input statuses are
 individually kept for each buffer, and prefix-keys such as C-x
 and C-c can be used even if IBus is active. So you can input
 various languages fast and comfortably by using it.
